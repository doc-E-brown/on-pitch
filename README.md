# Welcome to On Pitch!

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/faf1f48a-1911-4066-8087-76227d183776/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/projects/on-pitch/deploys)

On-Pitch is designed to help football coaches manage their teams during a match. I (a
volunteer coach of my son's U11 team) wrote On-Pitch to provide a stress free way of
ensuring each player got their fair share of time on the field. If anyone else finds this
app useful, they are free to use it at no cost.

The application is deployed to https://on-pitch.space.

The get started developing with On-Pitch:

1. Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
2. Clone the repository
3. Run `pnpm install` to install the dependencies
